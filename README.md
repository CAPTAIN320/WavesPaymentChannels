# Waves Platform Payment Channels

One of the most significant and most cited problems of current blockchain implementations is scalability. Here,
a major strategy is to offload transactions from the major blockchain network, which still cryptographically
secure the transfers in a way. The most prominent way of doing this, is payment channels, as used, e.g., in
the Bitcoin Lightning network.

## Usecases

## Prerequisites
This implementation of Payment Channels for the Waves network is implemented in NodeJS. Therefore, for using it
a proper NodeJS installation is necessary, as described [here](https://nodejs.org/). After its installation of
NodeJS, the githup repo can be cloned by
```
git clone git@github.com:jansenmarc/WavesPaymentChannels.git
```
Afterwards, missing requirements can be installed by
```
npm install
```
from the cloned directory.
